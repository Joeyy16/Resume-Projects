These projects demonstrate proficiency utilizing JavaScript for Back End Development.

- NPM (Node Package Manager)
  * Command line tool used to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js.
- Basic Node and Express
  * Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript.
  * Express is a lightweight web application framework & is one of the most popular packages on npm. Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing for your application, which handles things like directing people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like /blog.
- MongoDB and Mongoose
  * MongoDB is a database application that stores JSON documents (or records) that you can use in your application. Unlike SQL, another type of database, MongoDB is a non-relational or "NoSQL" database. This means MongoDB stores all associated data within one record, instead of storing it across many preset tables as in a SQL database.
  * Mongoose is a popular npm package for interacting with MongoDB. With Mongoose, you can use plain JavaScript objects instead of JSON, which makes it easier to work with MongoDB. Also, it allows you to create blueprints for your documents called schemas, so you don't accidentally save the wrong type of data and cause bugs later.
