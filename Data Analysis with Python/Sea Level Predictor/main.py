"""
The code above is importing a module called sea_level_predictor and calling a function within it called draw_plot(). Without further context, it is difficult to provide a detailed explanation of what this function does or what it is expected to return. It is possible that the function is used to generate a plot related to sea level data, but this cannot be confirmed without access to the implementation of the function.
