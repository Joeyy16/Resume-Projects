"""
This code imports the medical_data_visualizer module and calls two functions from it, draw_cat_plot and draw_heat_map. These functions are likely used to create visualizations using data from a medical dataset. The draw_cat_plot function likely generates a categorical plot, which is a type of chart used to display the distribution of a categorical variable. The draw_heat_map function likely generates a heat map, which is a graphical representation of data where values are represented as colors. Both of these functions are called without any arguments, so they are likely using default parameters or accessing data from a global scope within the medical_data_visualizer module.
