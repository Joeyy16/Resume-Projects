"""
The code above is calling three functions from the time_series_visualizer module. These functions are draw_line_plot(), draw_bar_plot(), and draw_box_plot(). These functions are expected to create and save plots using time series data. The first function, draw_line_plot(), creates and saves a line plot. The second function, draw_bar_plot(), creates and saves a bar plot. The third function, draw_box_plot(), creates and saves a box plot. It is not possible to provide more information about these functions without seeing their code.
