<!--
This is an HTML code for a web page that includes a simple markdown previewer built with React. The page includes a link to a stylesheet file called "styles.css" for styling the page, and links to the Font Awesome and Prism libraries for adding icons and syntax highlighting to the page, respectively. The page has a title of "FCC: Simple React Markdown Previewer".

The page has a single div element with an id of "app", which will be used by the React app to render its components.

The page includes several external script files: the React and React DOM libraries, the Marked library for parsing markdown, and the Prism library for syntax highlighting. The page also includes a script file called "bundle.js", which likely contains the JavaScript code for the React app.
