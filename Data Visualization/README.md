These projects demonstrate my proficiency building data visualizations using the D3.js library.

- D3 (Data Driven Documents)
  * JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations in the browser.
  * Built to work with common web standards â€“ namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). 
  * Supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.
- JSON APIs and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
  * APIs are tools that computers use to communicate with one another, in part to send and receive data.
  * Programmers often use AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) when working with APIs. AJAX refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. And the data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
