This is an HTML file that includes a style sheet and two JavaScript files. The style sheet and JavaScript files are used to style and interact with the contents of the HTML file.

The HTML file includes three links that allow the user to select between different data sets. It also includes an svg element with an id attribute of "tree-map" and a width and height of 960 and 570 pixels, respectively. This svg element will be used to display a tree map visualization of the selected data set.

The HTML file also includes an svg element with an id attribute of "legend" and a width of 500 pixels. This svg element will be used to display a legend for the tree map visualization.

Finally, the HTML file includes a script element that will load a script file named "script.js", which will contain the code to generate and interact with the tree map visualization and legend.
