These projects demonstrate my fluency in JavaScript as well as my ability to utilize the language to make webpages interactive.

- ES6 (ECMAScript)
  * Standardized version of JavaScript.
  * ES6, released in 2015, added many powerful new features to the language.
- Regular Expressions
  * Patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text. 
- Debugging
  * Issues in code generally come in three forms: syntax errors that prevent your program from running, runtime errors where your code has unexpected behavior, or logical errors where your code doesn't do what you intended.
- Data Structures
  * Data can be stored and accessed in many ways, i.e. arrays & objects
- Algorithm Scripting
  * A series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
- Object Oriented Programming
  * One of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do.
- Functional Programming
  * Code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.
