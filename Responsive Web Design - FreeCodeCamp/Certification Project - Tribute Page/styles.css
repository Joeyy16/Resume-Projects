/* 
This is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file that specifies styles for an HTML document.

The first rule applies to all elements in the document and sets the box-sizing property to "border-box" and the text-align property to "center". This means that the dimensions of an element will include its padding and border, and the text inside the element will be aligned to the center.

The second rule applies to the main element and sets the margin to 1em, the background-color to grey, and the border-radius to 10px. This means that the main element will have a margin of 1em on all sides, a grey background color, and rounded corners with a radius of 10px.

The third rule applies to the body element and sets the margin to 0, the font-family to sans-serif, and the background to #f5f6f7. This means that the body element will have no margin, the font used will be a sans-serif font, and the background color will be #f5f6f7.

The fourth rule applies to the header element and sets the text-align to "center", the text-transform to "uppercase", the padding to 32px, and the color to #fff. This means that the text inside the header element will be aligned to the center, transformed to uppercase, have a padding of 32px on all sides, and the color will be white.

The fifth rule applies to elements with the class "img-div" and sets the margin to 2em, the max-width to 100%, the height to "auto", the align-items property to "center", the border-radius to 10px, and the background-color to white. This means that elements with the class "img-div" will have a margin of 2em on all sides, a maximum width of 100%, a height that adjusts automatically to the content, their child elements will be aligned to the center, rounded corners with a radius of 10px, and a white background color.

The sixth rule applies to the img element and sets the display to "block", the width and max-width to 100%, the height to "auto", the object-fit property to "cover", the border-radius to 10px, and the padding-bottom to 2em. This means that the img element will be displayed as a block element, it will take up the full width of its parent element and have a maximum width of 100%, its height will adjust automatically to the content, the image will be resized to cover the entire element while maintaining its aspect ratio, it will have rounded corners with a radius of 10px
